## Deploying to Firebase Hosting

### Step 1: Install Dependencies & Build
Open your terminal in the extracted project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
This will compile all TypeScript files, Tailwind CSS, and React components into the `dist/` directory.

### Step 2: Initialize Firebase CLI
If you haven't installed Firebase tools yet:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```

Initialize your Firebase project in the root folder:
```bash
firebase init hosting
```
- Select your existing Firebase project.
- When asked for public directory, enter `dist`.
- Configure as single-page app (rewrite all URLs to `/index.html`): `Yes`.

### Step 3: Deploy to Firebase
Run:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
Your NETBYBIT platform will be live on your custom Firebase Hosting domain!
